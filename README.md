# üê¨ CNN for Marine Mammal Sound Classification

Welcome to the **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** project! This repository is dedicated to building a deep-learning model for sound detection by classifying spectrogram images generated from audio signals. The project utilizes techniques such as **Residual Connections**, **Batch Normalization**, and **Global Average Pooling** to handle the dataset effectively.

The primary goal of this project is to detect and classify audio signals (e.g., marine mammal sounds) by converting them into spectrogram images, which are visual representations of the sound's frequency content over time. The CNN model is trained to analyze these spectrograms and identify distinct audio patterns associated with different classes of sounds.
